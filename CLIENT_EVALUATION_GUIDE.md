### 4. Volume and Performance

**Question**: How many documents need to be processed?

**Benchmarks** (approximate, varies by document complexity):

| Configuration | Docs/Hour | Docs/Day (8h) | Hardware |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| CPU (4 cores) | ~100-200 | 800-1,600 | Standard server |
| CPU (8 cores) | ~200-400 | 1,600-3,200 | High-end server |
| GPU (single) | ~500-1000 | 4,000-8,000 | NVIDIA T4/V100 |
| GPU (multi) | ~2000-4000 | 16,000-32,000 | 4x NVIDIA T4 |

**Note**: Actual throughput depends on:
- Document complexity
- Image resolution
- Required features (OCR only vs. full parsing)
- Hardware specifications

### 5. Integration Requirements

**Question**: How will PaddleOCR integrate with existing systems?

**Options**:

#### A. Python Library (Embedded)
```python
from paddleocr import PaddleOCR
ocr = PaddleOCR()
result = ocr.ocr('document.jpg')
```

**Pros**: Direct integration, lowest latency, full control
**Cons**: Requires Python environment, manages resources directly

#### B. REST API Service
```bash
curl -X POST http://api.example.com/ocr \
  -F "file=@document.jpg" \
  -F "language=en"
```

**Pros**: Language-agnostic, easy to scale, stateless
**Cons**: Network latency, needs deployment infrastructure

#### C. Microservice (Docker)
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 paddleocr-service
```

**Pros**: Isolated environment, easy deployment, scalable
**Cons**: Container overhead, orchestration needed

#### D. Cloud Function (Serverless)

**Pros**: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use, no infrastructure management
**Cons**: Cold start latency, may need custom deployment

### 6. Output Format

**Question**: What format should the output be in?

**Available formats**:

1. **JSON** (Default)
```json
{
  "text": "Extracted text",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "box": [[x1,y1], [x2,y2], [x3,y3], [x4,y4]]
}
```

2. **Structured Data**
```json
{
  "layout": {
    "title": "Document Title",
    "paragraphs": [...],
    "tables": [...]
  }
}
```

3. **Markdown** (for document parsing)
```markdown
# Document Title

Content here...

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   |
```

4. **CSV/Excel** (for table extraction)
```csv
Column 1,Column 2,Column 3
Value 1,Value 2,Value 3
```

5. **HTML** (for tables)
```html
<table>
  <tr><td>Cell 1</td><td>Cell 2</td></tr>
</table>
```
