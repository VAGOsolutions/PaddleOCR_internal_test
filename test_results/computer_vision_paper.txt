1. Advances in Computer Vision:
2. From CNNs to Vision Transformers
3. Alice Chen · Bob Wilson - Carol Davis
4. University of California, Berkeley
5. ABSTRACT
6. Computer vision has evolved dramatically with deep learning. This paper
7. reviews the progression from convolutional neural networks to modern
8. vision transformers. We analyze architectural innovations, training
9. techniques, and performance improvements across image classification,
10. object detection, and segmentation tasks. Our experiments demonstrate
11. that hybrid approaches combining CNNs and transformers achieve optimal
12. results for most vision tasks
13. 1. INTRODUCTION
14. Deep learning has transformed computer vision since AlexNet's
15. breakthrough in 2012. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) became
16. the dominant architecture for image-related tasks.
17. Recent introduction of Vision Transformers (ViT) challenges this
18. paradigm, showing that attention-based models can match or exceed
19. CNN performance when trained on sufficient data.
20. 2. BACKGROUND
21. 2.1 Convolutional Neural Networks
22. CNNs use local receptive fields and parameter sharing to process
23. images efficiently. Key architectures include ResNet, VGG, and
24. Inception networks.
25. 2.2 Vision Transformers
26. ViT applies transformer architecture to image patches. Self-attention
27. mechanisms capture global dependencies without convolutions.
28. 3. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
29. We evaluate models on ImageNet-1K (1.3M images, 1000 classes).
30. Training uses standard data augmentation: random crops, flips,
31. and color jittering. All models trained for 300 epochs with
32. AdamW optimizer.
