Version
8.11 Conduct Audit Log Reviews
v8
Conduct reviews of audit logs to detect anomalies or abnormal events that could
indicate a potential threat. Conduct reviews on a weekly, or more frequent, basis.
13.1 Centralize Security Event Alerting
Centralize security event alerting across enterprise assets for log correlation
v8
and analysis. Best practice implementation requires the use of a SlEM, which
includes vendor-defined event correlation alerts. A log analytics platform configured
with security-relevant correlation alerts also satisfies this Safeguard.
13.11 Tune Security Event Alerting Thresholds
v8
Tune security event alerting thresholds monthly, or more frequently.
6.6 Deploy SIEM or Log Analytic tool
v7
Deploy Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or log analytic tool
for log correlation and analysis.
6.7 Regularly Review Logs
v7
On a regular basis, review logs to identify anomalies or abnormal events.
6.8 Regularly Tune SIEM
v7
On a regular basis, tune your SlEM system to better identify actionable events
and decrease event noise.
