5. The lack of text in "disk_encryption_key_crn": and"backup_encryption_key_crn":
means that your deployment is encrypted at rest with IBM managed encryption
keys. If there is text after "crn" then that will be the unique identifier of the
encryption key that is customer-managed for encryption at rest or for backups.
Remediation:
No remediation procedure. Impossible for end-user to impact this control in a negative
way.
Default Value:
By default all objects stored on IBM Cloud Databases are encrypted at-rest.

Version
3.11 Encrypt Sensitive Data at Rest
Encrypt sensitive data at rest on servers, applications, and databases containing
sensitive data. Storage-layer encryption, also known as server-side encryption,
v8
meets the minimum requirement of this Safeguard. Additional encryption methods
may include application-layer encryption, also known as client-side encryption,
where access to the data storage device(s) does not permit access to the plain-text
data.
